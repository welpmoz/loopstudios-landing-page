## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. But you could also choose to do this without JS!

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### What I've Learned

I've set up Tailwind CSS in my Vite project. Below are the steps I followed:

#### Installing Tailwind CSS

1. Install Tailwind CSS using pnpm:

   ```sh
   pnpm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
   ```

2. Configure Tailwind CSS in `vite.config.ts`:

   ```ts
   import { defineConfig } from "vite";
   import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";

   export default defineConfig({
     plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],
   });
   ```

For more details, check the [Tailwind CSS Installation Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite).

### Configuring Prettier for Tailwind CSS

To ensure Tailwind classes are formatted correctly, I configured Prettier as follows:

1. Install the Tailwind CSS Prettier plugin:

   ```sh
   pnpm install -D prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
   ```

2. Update the `.prettierrc.json` file:
   ```json
   {
     "plugins": ["prettier-plugin-tailwindcss"],
     "tailwindStylesheet": "./src/index.css"
   }
   ```

For more details, refer to the [Tailwind CSS Editor Setup Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup).

---

### Setting Up VS Code

To ensure this setup works properly, I configured VS Code with the following steps:

1. Open VS Code and press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows) to open the command palette.
   ![Command Palette](./docs/palette.png)

2. Search for `User Settings (JSON)` and select the first option.
   ![Search Settings](./docs/search.png)

3. Update `settings.json` with the following configurations:
   ```json
   {
     "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
     "editor.formatOnSave": true
   }
   ```

These settings ensure that Prettier automatically formats your code on save.

And that's it!

Finally, I decided not to use Tailwind CSS for the reasons mentioned here. However, I believe this configuration might be helpful for others.
